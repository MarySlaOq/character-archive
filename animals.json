They aren't very strong alone, but since dandelions are always together, they are often in groups and kill preys together. They're venomous, alone can't make someone sleep, just get tired, but a whole lot of them can make the body of the prey stop functioning If they sense their tail pulling them from the soul or being cut, they'll leave the ground and attack. The tail grows back, like a lizard, but the wings dont",
