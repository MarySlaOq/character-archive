    <h1>The world relationship building app</h1>

    <h2>How to create with the app!</h2>
    <p>
      Outside the "www" directory there is a file called data.json, this file
      has all the world and character data, you can create various dimensions
      with diferent worlds by just creating a new file with the same format and
      inputing the file's name in the "www/index.html" file in the line shown
      bellow, that way the displayed data will change and the other file's
      information is still saved
      <br />

    </ul>

    <h2>People</h2>
    <p>
      When editing the "people" attribute in the json data file, you can create
      a person by adding an object to the array and giving that object an unique
      id, a name, and a list of social media links, a social media link is an
      object with the name of the site and the hyperlink to the account. People
      represent creators of characters, a character can have multiple creators.
    </p>

    <h2>Worlds</h2>
    <p>
      A world is a tab in the big tabbed pane on the display page, it contains a
      name, outline and characters which live in this world.
    </p>

    <h2>Characters</h2>
    <p>
      Characters have a lot of attributes, this attributes can be seen when this
      character is interacted with in the world view, a character has a lot of
      identifying features but still needs an unique id. <br />
      The creators of a character need to be given as an array of people ids.
      The highlight of a character is the color of it's border, it can be given
      as a
      <a href="https://www.w3.org/wiki/CSS/Properties/color/keywords"
        >css default colour keyword</a
      >
      or an <a href="https://htmlcolorcodes.com/">hexadecimal color</a>
      <br />
      Relationships can be defined by adding an object to the array "relations"
      of a character, a relation needs 2 attributes, "to", which is the id of
      the second character in this relationship, and "details", which let you
      specify the relationship between the two
